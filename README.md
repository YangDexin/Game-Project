##Summary:

We design a clearance game by “Game Maker” application.In order to avoid issues of infringementall, 
all sources of videos, photos and sounds which we created by ourself.

##A description of the development process your team:

First, we determined the type of our game (it is a clearance Game) and we discussed the story about our game. Second, because our game was basic on a huge story, we had to write the story by ourselves. Third, we allotted jobs for every teammates. For example, Zijing drew all photos such as characters by himself. Dexin did edit photo, music synthesis, design dialogue and test the game. Guangyu use Game maker and Flash to design the game and videos. 

##Techniques used:
We mostly used Game maker to build the game. Meanwhile, we also used other APP such as Flash, Photoshop, Music editing tools (Chinese App), Variable sound (Chinese App, we used it to change our voice in order to make dialogue in the game video) and so on.

##Sources of sounds:
We design dialogue and record it by ourself.

##Source of videos and photos:
We draw character by photoshop application.
