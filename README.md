all sources of videos, photos and sounds which we created by ourself.

##A description of the development process your team:

First, we determined the type of our game (it is a clearance Game) and we discussed the story about our game. Second, because our game was basic on a huge story, we had to write the story by ourselves. Third, we allotted jobs for every teammates. For example, Zijing drew all photos such as characters by himself. Dexin did edit photo, music synthesis, design dialogue and test the game. Guangyu use Game maker and Flash to design the game and videos. 

##Techniques used:
